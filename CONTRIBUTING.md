## 🎨 Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for code formatting
- Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting

### Commands to Run

```bash
# Format code
black cyberfind/

# Sort imports
isort cyberfind/

# Lint code
flake8 cyberfind/

# Run all formatters
black cyberfind/ && isort cyberfind/ && flake8 cyberfind/
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after a blank line

```bash
git commit -m "Brief summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. The blank line separating
the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely).
Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you are
making this change as opposed to how (the code explains how).
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=cyberfind tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test function names
- Follow the `test_` prefix convention
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use `pytest` fixtures for setup/teardown

### Example Test

```python
def test_username_validation():
    """Test that invalid usernames are properly rejected."""
    assert validate_username("valid_user") == True
    assert validate_username("") == False
    assert validate_username("user@invalid") == False
```
